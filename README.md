# Route Optimisation using Genetic Algorithms

This repository implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) for optimising delivery routes in Munich, Germany. The algorithm finds the shortest possible route that visits all delivery locations and returns to the depot while minimizing total travel distance.

Key Features
- Real-world road network data from OpenStreetMap (OSM)
- Genetic Algorithm (GA) for route optimisation
- DEAP framework for evolutionary computation
- Visualisation tools for route analysis
